# CAML-Designer
Public repository for the CAML Designer tool

The CAML Designer is an old tool that has been developed to enable SharePoint developers to build CAML queries. 

The current version of the CAML Designerhas been recompiled against .NET Framework 4.7.2 and only supports SharePoint Online for the time being. But that will change soon enough.

You can connect to SharePoint Online, SharePoint 2019, SharePoint 2016 and SharePoint 2013 through the Client Object model. For the older versions of SharePoint you have to connect through the Web Services of SharePoint. I have no old version of SharePoint anymore, so I was not able to test that part of the code.

The user interface is still WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and it deserves a fresh look.
