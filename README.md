# CAML-Designer
Public repository for the CAML Designer tool

The CAML Designer is an old tool that has been developed to enable SharePoint developers to build CAML queries. 

The current version of the CAML Designerhas been recompiled against .NET Framework 4.7.2 and only supports SharePoint Online for the time being. But that will change soon enough.

The user interface is still WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and it deserves a fresh look.
